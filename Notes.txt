	DataFrame
}

over view
{
	group data
	{
		use grouped data to calculate simple risk measurements.
	}
	reshaping
	{}
	reorganizing
	{}
	aggregating
	{
		preform aggregate operations on grouped data to assist with deriving analytic results.
	}
	time-series,
	time-series, stock data
	{
		retrieve and perform various financial calculations using historical stock quotes obtained from Google/Yahoo!

		retrieve quotes,

		}
	}

	trading using google trend
	{
		form correlations between index dta and trends in searches on Google.
		{}
		gather index data from Quandl along with trend data from Google
		{}
		correlate time-series data and use that information to generate trade signals
		{}
		calculate the effectiveness of the trading strategy as compared to the actual market performance.
		{}
	}

	Algorithmic Trading
	{
		trading strategies
		{
			simple moving averages,
			exponentially weighted averages,
			crossovers,
			pairs-trading
		}
		back testing
		{
			Zipline, an open source back-testing tool, to simulate trading behavior on historical data.
		}

	}

	working with options
	{
		model and evaluate options
		{
			what is options,
			how they function,
			how to calculate their payoffs,
		}
		load options data from Yahoo! Finance into pandas data structures 
		examine various options attributes
		{
			implied volatility
			volatility smiles and smirks
		}
	}

	Portfolios and risk
	{
		model portfolios of multiple stocks.
		Modern Portfolio Theory
		calculate the risk and returns of a portfolio,
		assign different weights to different instruments in a portfolio,
		derive the Sharpe ratio,
		calculate efficient frontiers and value at risk
		optimize portfolio instrument allocation.
