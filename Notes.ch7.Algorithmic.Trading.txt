the process of algorithmic trading
{
    Algorithmic trading is the use of an automated system to execute trades in a market

    two broad categories for predicting movemnet in the market
    {
        momentum strategies
        {
            In momentum trading, 
            trading focuses on stocks that are 
            * moving in a specific direction on high volume, 
            * measuring the rate of change in price changes.

            It is typically 
            measured by continuously computing 
            price differences 
            at fixed time intervals.

            Momentum
            {
                a useful indicator of the strenth or weakness of the price
                although 
                it is typically more useful during rising markets 
                as they occur more frequently than falling markets;
                therefore, 
                momentum-based prediction gives better results in a rising market.
            } 
        }
        mean-reversion strategies
        {
            Mean reversion is a theory in trading that prices and returns will eventually move
back towards the mean of the stock or of another historical average, such as the
growth of the economy or an industry average. When the market price is below the
average price, a stock is considered attractive for purchase as it is expected that the
price will rise and, hence, a profit can be made by buying and holding the stock as it
rises and then selling at its peak. If the current market price is above the mean, the
expectation is the price will fall and there is potential for profit in shorting the stock.
        }
    }

    moving averages strategies
    {
Whether using a momentum or mean-reversion strategy for trading, the analyses
will, in one form or another, utilize moving averages of the closing price of stocks.
We have seen these before when we looked at calculating a rolling mean. We will
now examine several different forms of rolling means and cover several concepts
that are important to use in order to make trading decisions based upon how one
or more means move over time:
• Simple moving average
• Exponential moving average

        simple moving average
        {
            A moving average is a technical analysis technique that smooths price data by
calculating a constantly updated average price. This average is taken over a specific
period of time, ranging from minutes, to days, weeks, and months. The period
selected depends on the type of movement of interest, such as making a decision
on short-term, medium-term, or long-term investment.
Moving averages give us a means to relate the price data to determine a trend indicator.
A moving average does not predict price direction but instead gives us a means of
determining the direction of the price with a lag, which is the size of the window.
In financial markets, a moving average can be considered support in a rising market
and resistance in a falling market.
